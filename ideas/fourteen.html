        <h1>Tax Preparation</h1>
        <p>
          It’s not the sort of side business idea that’s covered in glory, but
          someone needs to make sure all the numbers add up at the end of the
          year. Every business and most individuals need someone with the domain
          expertise to help prepare tax returns, especially time or
          resource-strapped small business owners.

          >Majo Jacinto in his Udemy course</a
          > provides an in-depth foundational
          understanding of how to prepare tax returns (and stay current with
          ever-changing laws) that’ll certify you with tax prep skills in as
          little as a few hours of training and practice. Then once tax season
          rolls around you’ll be able to charge an <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-much-should-you-pay-for-tax-prep/">average of $229 per return</a> as
          a freelance tax preparer with these kinds of side business ideas,
          according to CNBC—and you could even grow your business more by
          teaching your advice online (like taxes for bloggers, influencers and
          remote employees).
