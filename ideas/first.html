        <h1>Start a Blog</h1>
        <p>
          Think blogging is no longer a viable source of income? Think again.
          Recent blogging statistics show that tens of thousands of bloggers
          (including yours truly) are creating profitable content on topics as
          diverse as scrapbooking, home cooking, travel, film, lifestyle,
          business, personal finance and more. The best part? It doesn’t cost
          much to blog—about $65/year. And more people are growing their blogs
          into six-figure businesses thanks to a combination of email
          subscribers, affiliate marketing, blog sponsorships, and other revenue
          streams. Your first step with starting a blog is quickly getting the
          technical side of things handled (my free master course on blogging
          will show you how), and then both understanding what your audience
          craves and learning how to attract those readers online.

          If you want to speed up the process of launching your blog, I
          recommend setting up quick, affordable and easy website hosting with a
          company like Bluehost or one of the other best web hosting plans for
          bloggers, working through the process of creating a blog business plan
          and choosing a simple WordPress theme and working on your first
          post—in order to set the precedent of prioritizing your time on
          creating content, connecting with (and building) your target audience.
          You’ll also need to employ the right blogging tools to grow your blog
          along the way.
